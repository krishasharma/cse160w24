# CSE 160: Computer Graphics 
# Program 1 

# Implementation Overview
This project involves the implementation of a Surface of Revolution (SOR) OBJ file generator. The SOR is generated based on a profile curve and user-defined parameters, such as the number of sides for the cross-sectional shape and the choice to draw end caps.


Conversion of profile coordinates to webGL coordinates.
Rotation of the profile to either XZ-plane or YZ-plane.
Generation of the SOR based on user-defined parameters.
Option to specify the number of sides for the cross-sectional shape.
Option to draw or skip end caps.


# Files Given
- features.html
- driver.html
- SORscript.js
- sor_coordinates.obj
- sor_polygons.obj

# Known Errors 
There are currently no known errors in this implementation

# User Guide 
To use the SOR OBJ file generator:
- Open the driver.html file in a web browser.
- Follow the prompts to specify the number of sides for the cross-sectional shape (e.g., 3 for triangular).
- Choose whether to draw end caps (OK for yes, Cancel for no).
- Check the browser's developer console for messages and logs.
- Download the generated SOR OBJ files for coordinates and polygons.
