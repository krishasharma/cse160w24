# 3D Heart Project in Three.js

## Overview
This project is an exploration of three.js, a high-level WebGL library, to create a realistic and interactive 3D heart model.

## Features
- **3D Heart Shape**: A beautifully rendered heart using advanced geometry in three.js.
- **Interactive Camera Controls**: Users can rotate and zoom in on the model to view it from different angles.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Enhances the visual appeal and realism of the heart model.

## Running the Project
To view the 3D heart:
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

## Development
Developed with three.js for a simple yet powerful 3D rendering of complex shapes, this project serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of WebGL and three.js in graphical applications.
