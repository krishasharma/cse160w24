# CSE 160: Computer Graphics 
# Program 0 

# General Discription given for Assignment
Allow the user to interactively create a polyline -- a curve made up of piecewise line segments. The curve is specified by consecutive mouse clicks with straight line segments connecting them. Use left mouse clicks to add points, and a right mouse click to end the polyline. we will be working though a series of assignments that will be built on top of each other. The curve created in this assignment will be used as a profile curve for creating a surface of revolution (SOR) that will then be used in subsequent assignments. At the start, your screen will show a horizontal red axis and a green vertical axis. Note that the origin of the Canvas screen is on the top left corner. At the end, your screen will show the polyline. In this example, 3 left clicks were followed by a single right click. The console shows the Canvas coordinates of the 4 points. Also note that the console logs an error message -- used here to indicate the end of the program. It actually doesn't end but allows one to continue. We just want the points up to the first right click.
