# 3D Cube WebGL Demo

## Overview

This project is a WebGL-based 3D graphics demonstration that allows users to interact with a cube rendered in a web browser. The cube can be displayed in either flat shading or wireframe mode, and users can control its rotation and scaling via sliders.

## Features

- Rendering a cube in 3D using WebGL.
- Toggle between flat shading and wireframe modes.
- Control cube rotation and scaling using sliders.
- Interactive controls using keyboard inputs.

## Usage

1. Open the `driver.html` file in a modern web browser.
2. Use the sliders to adjust the cube's rotation and scale.
3. Press the 'W' key to toggle between wireframe and flat shading modes.

## Development

This project was developed using pure WebGL and JavaScript without relying on external 3D libraries.
